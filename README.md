# BioSensor
This repository contains codes & computational tools developed by team Indriya @ Dept. of Computational Biology & Bioinformatics,
University of Kerala.

## How to run the program
1. Load the 128*128 pixel image samples in the folder 'Samples'
2. Run Image_analysis.ipynb; this will generate a csv file with Red component of each image samples
3. Run 'RunMe.m or Designer.py' for the rest of the plotting
